In this paper, we study $k$-sparse commitments in games where one player is restricted to mixed strategies with support size at most k. Finding k-sparse commitments is known to be computationally hard. We start by showing several structural properties of $k$-sparse solutions, including that the optimal support may vary dramatically as k increases. These results suggest that naive greedy or double-oracle-based approaches are unlikely to yield practical algorithms. We then develop a simple approach based on mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) for zero-sum games, general-sum Stackelberg games, and various forms of structured sparsity. We also propose practical algorithms for cases where one or both players have large (i.e., practically innumerable) action sets, utilizing a combination of MILPs and incremental strategy generation. We evaluate our methods on synthetic and real-world scenarios based on security applications. In both settings, we observe that even for small support sizes, we can obtain more than 90% of the true Nash value while maintaining a reasonable runtime, demonstrating the significance of our formulation and algorithms.","tags":null,"title":"Commitment to Sparse Strategies in Two-Player Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jakub Cerny","Chun Kai Ling","Darshan Chakrabarti","Jingwen Zhang","Gabriele Farina","Christian Kroer","Garud Iyengar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1723766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1723766400,"objectID":"8243acb412197bdf5f10e99b9fb3e5bb","permalink":"https://lingchunkai.github.io/publication/contested-logistics/","publishdate":"2024-08-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/contested-logistics/","section":"publication","summary":"We introduce Contested Logistics Games, a variant of logistics problems that account for the presence of an adversary that can disrupt the movement of goods in selected areas.

Our formulation entails not only classic pursuit-evasion games, but also other security games, such as those modeling anti-terrorism and logistical interdiction. We study two-player zero-sum games under two distinct utility models: linear and binary utilities. We show that under linear utilities, Nash equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, while binary utilities may lead to situations where even computing a best-response is computationally intractable. To this end, we propose a practical algorithm based on incremental strategy generation and mixed integer linear programs.

Using a precise information-theoretic definition of interactions, our key contribution is the derivation of lower and upper bounds to quantify the amount of multimodal interactions in this semi-supervised setting.

The majority of existing machine learning-based survival analysis methods assume that survival is conditionally independent of censoring given a set of covariates; an assumption that cannot be verified since only marginal distributions is available from the data. The existence of dependent censoring, along with the inherent bias in current estimators has been demonstrated in a variety of applications, accentuating the need for a more nuanced approach. However, existing methods that adjust for dependent censoring require practitioners to specify the ground truth copula. This requirement poses a significant challenge for practical applications, as model misspecification can lead to substantial bias. In this work, we propose a flexible deep learning-based survival analysis method that simultaneously accommodate for dependent censoring and eliminates the requirement for specifying the ground truth copula. We theoretically prove the identifiability of our model under a broad family of copulas and survival distributions.

To answer these questions, we propose an information-theoretic approach to quantify the degree of redundancy, uniqueness, and synergy relating input modalities with an output task. We term these three measures as the PID statistics of a multimodal distribution (or PID for short), and introduce two new estimators for these PID statistics that scale to high-dimensional distributions. To validate PID estimation, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets where the PID is known and on large-scale multimodal benchmarks where PID estimations are compared with human annotations. Finally, we demonstrate their usefulness in (1) quantifying interactions within multimodal datasets, (2) quantifying interactions captured by multimodal models, (3) principled approaches for model selection, and (4) three real-world case studies engaging with domain experts in pathology, mood prediction, and robotic perception where our framework helps to recommend strong multimodal models for each application.","tags":null,"title":"Quantifying \u0026 Modeling Multimodal Interactions: An Information Decomposition Framework","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zimeng Song, Chun Kai Ling, Fei Fang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1694736000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694736000,"objectID":"9d70db6d4afe67af906134608d43566b","permalink":"https://lingchunkai.github.io/publication/multileader-security/","publishdate":"2023-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/multileader-security/","section":"publication","summary":"Stackelberg Security Games are often used to model strategic interactions in high-stakes security settings. The majority of existing models focus on single-defender settings where a single entity assumes command of all security assets. However, many realistic scenarios feature \textit{multiple heterogeneous defenders} with their own interests and priorities embedded in a more complex system. Furthermore, defenders rarely choose targets to protect. Instead, they have a multitude of defensive resources or \textit{schedules} at its disposal, each with different protective capabilities. In this paper, we study security games featuring multiple defenders and schedules simultaneously. We show that unlike prior work on multi-defender security games, the introduction of schedules can cause non-existence of equilibrium even under rather restricted environments. We prove that under the mild restriction that any subset of a schedule is also a schedule, non-existence of equilibrium is not only avoided, but can be computed in polynomial time in games with two defenders. Under additional assumptions, our algorithm can be extended to games with more than two defenders and its computation scaled up in special classes of games with compactly represented schedules such as those used in patrolling applications. Experimental results suggest that our methods scale gracefully with game size, making our algorithms amongst the few that can tackle multiple heterogeneous defenders.","tags":null,"title":"Multi-defender Security Games with Schedules","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samuel Sokota","Ryan D'Orazio","Chun Kai Ling","David J Wu","J Zico Kolter","Noam Brown"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1687478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687478400,"objectID":"9f591336e7c261d07531e2fd9569fdaf","permalink":"https://lingchunkai.github.io/publication/abstracting-imperfect-2p0s/","publishdate":"2023-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/abstracting-imperfect-2p0s/","section":"publication","summary":"In their seminal work, Nayyar et al. (2013) showed that imperfect information can be abstracted away from common-payoff games by having players publicly announce their policies as they play. This insight underpins sound solvers and decision-time planning algorithms for common-payoff games. Unfortunately, a naive application of the same insight to two-player zero-sum games fails because Nash equilibria of the game with public policy announcements may not correspond to Nash equilibria of the original game. As a consequence, existing sound decision-time planning algorithms require complicated additional mechanisms that have unappealing properties. The main contribution of this work is showing that certain regularized equilibria do not possess the aforementioned non-correspondence problem---thus, computing them can be treated as perfect-information problems. Because these regularized equilibria can be made arbitrarily close to Nash equilibria, our result opens the door to a new perspective to solving two-player zero-sum games and yields a simplified framework for decision-time planning in two-player zero-sum games, void of the unappealing properties that plague existing decision-time planning approaches.","tags":null,"title":"Abstracting Imperfect Information Away from Two-Player Zero-Sum Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chun Kai Ling","J.

Yet, little attention has been given towards FA in solving general-sum extensive-form games, despite them being widely regarded as being computationally more challenging than their fully competitive or cooperative counterparts. A key challenge is that for many equilibrium in general-sum games, no simple analogue to the state value function used in Markov Decision Processes and zero-sum games exists. In this paper, we propose learning the Enforceable Payoff Frontier (EPF)---a generalization of the state value function for general-sum games. We approximate the optimal Stackelberg extensive-form correlated equilibrium by representing EPFs with neural networks and training them by using appropriate backup operations and loss functions. This is the first method that applies FA to the Stackelberg setting, allowing us to scale to much larger games while still enjoying performance guarantees based on FA error.

To alleviate these concerns, we apply \textit{subgame resolving}, a technique extremely successful in finding NE in zero-sum games to solving general-sum EFCEs. Subgame resolving refines a correlation plan in an \textit{online} manner: instead of solving for the full game upfront, it only solves for strategies in subgames that are reached in actual play, resulting in significant computational gains. In this paper, we (i) lay out the foundations to quantify the quality of a refined strategy, in terms of the \textit{social welfare} and \textit{exploitability} of correlation plans, (ii) show that EFCEs possess a sufficient amount of independence between subgames to perform resolving efficiently, and (iii) provide two algorithms for resolving, one using linear programming and the other based on regret minimization.

In this paper, we present a theoretically sound and empirically effective way to apply search, which leverages extra online computation to improve a solution, to the computation of Stackelberg equilibria in general-sum games. Instead of the leader attempting to solve the full game upfront, an approximate ``blueprint'' solution is first computed offline and is then improved online for the particular subgames encountered in actual play. We prove that our search technique is guaranteed to perform no worse than the pre-computed blueprint strategy, and empirically demonstrate that it enables approximately solving significantly larger games compared to purely offline methods. We also show that our search operation may be cast as a smaller Stackelberg problem, making our method complementary to existing algorithms based on strategy generation.","tags":null,"title":"Safe Search for Stackelberg Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dmitrii Kharkovskii","Chun Kai Ling","Bryan Kian Hsiang Low"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590364800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590364800,"objectID":"20bb83df8856a40f70c6484f941762d8","permalink":"https://lingchunkai.github.io/publication/gpp-macro-actions/","publishdate":"2020-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gpp-macro-actions/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a multi-staged approach to nonmyopic adaptive Gaussian process optimization (GPO) for Bayesian optimization (BO) of unknown, highly complex objective functions that, in contrast to existing nonmyopic adaptive BO algorithms, exploits the notion of macro-actions for scaling up to a further lookahead to match up to a larger available budget. To achieve this, we generalize GP upper confidence bound to a new acquisition function defined w.r.t. a nonmyopic adaptive macro-action policy, which is intractable to be optimized exactly due to an uncountable set of candidate outputs. The contribution of our work here is thus to derive a nonmyopic adaptive epsilon-Bayes-optimal macro-action GPO (epsilon-Macro-GPO) policy. To perform nonmyopic adaptive BO in real time, we then propose an asymptotically optimal anytime variant of our epsilon-Macro-GPO policy with a performance guarantee.

In this setting, the strategic behavior of players is complemented by an external device that privately recommends moves to agents as the game progresses; players are free to deviate at any time, but will then not receive future recommendations. Our contributions are threefold. First, we show that an EFCE can be formulated as the solution to a bilinear saddle-point problem. To showcase how this novel formulation can inspire new algorithms to compute EFCEs, we propose a simple subgradient descent method which exploits this formulation and structural properties of EFCEs. Our method has better scalability than the prior approach based on linear programming. Second, we propose two benchmark games, which we hope will serve as the basis for future evaluation of EFCE solvers. These games were chosen so as to cover two natural application domains for EFCE: conflict resolution via a mediator, and bargaining and negotiation. Third, we document the qualitative behavior of EFCE in our proposed games. We show that the social-welfare-maximizing equilibria in these games are highly nontrivial and exhibit surprisingly subtle sequential behavior that so far has not received attention in the literature.","tags":null,"title":"Correlation in Extensive-Form Games: Saddle-Point Formulation and Benchmarks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gabriele Farina","Chun Kai Ling","Fei Fang","Tuomas Sandholm"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575936000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575936000,"objectID":"4743c4dbe57603c67ed3788ad2f42bca","permalink":"https://lingchunkai.github.io/publication/efce-regret/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/efce-regret/","section":"publication","summary":"In the past few years, self-play methods based on regret minimization have become the state of the art for computing Nash equilibria in large two-players zero-sum extensive-form games. These methods fundamentally rely on the hierarchical structure of the players' sequential strategy spaces to construct a regret minimizer that recursively minimizes regret at each decision point in the game tree. In this paper, we introduce the first regret minimization algorithm for computing extensive-form correlated equilibria in large two-player mph{general-sum} games with no chance moves. Designing such an algorithm is significantly more challenging than designing one for the Nash equilibrium counterpart, as the constraints that define the space of correlation plans lack the hierarchical structure and might even form cycles. We show that some of the constraints are redundant and can be excluded from consideration, and present an efficient algorithm that generates the space of extensive-form correlation plans incrementally from the remaining constraints. This structural decomposition is achieved via a special convexity-preserving operation that we coin scaled extension. We show that a local regret minimizer can be designed for a scaled extension of any two convex sets, and that from the decomposition we then obtain a global regret minimizer. Our algorithm produces feasible iterates. Experiments show that it significantly outperforms prior approaches---the LP-based approach and a very recent subgradient descent algorithm---and for larger problems it is the only viable option.","tags":null,"title":"Efficient Regret Minimization Algorithm for Extensive-Form Correlated Equilibrium","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chun Kai Ling, Fei Fang, J.

Although a recent work provides a powerful differentiable end-to-end learning frameworks which embed a game solver within a deep-learning framework, allowing unknown game parameters to be learned via backpropagation, this framework faces significant limitations when applied to boundedly rational human agents and large scale problems, leading to poor practicality. In this paper, we address these limitations and propose a framework that is applicable for more practical settings. First, seeking to learn the rationality of human agents in complex two-player zero-sum games, we draw upon well-known ideas in decision theory to obtain a concise and interpretable agent behavior model, and derive solvers and gradients for end-to-end learning. Second, to scale up to large, real-world scenarios, we propose an efficient first-order primal-dual method which exploits the structure of extensive-form games, yielding significantly faster computation for both game solving and gradient computation. When tested on randomly generated games, we report speedups of orders of magnitude over previous approaches. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both real-world one-player settings and synthetic data.","tags":null,"title":"Large Scale Learning of Agent Rationality in Two-Player Zero-Sum Games","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  **Two**  Three   A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

This paper deals with the relatively under-explored but equally important 'inverse' setting, where the parameters of the underlying game are not known to all agents, but must be learned through observations. We propose a differentiable, end-to-end learning framework for addressing this task. In particular, we consider a regularized version of the game, equivalent to a particular form of quantal response equilibrium, and develop 1) a primal-dual Newton method for finding such equilibrium points in both normal and extensive form games; and 2) a backpropagation method that lets us analytically compute gradients of all relevant game parameters through the solution itself. This ultimately lets us learn the game by training in an end-to-end fashion, effectively by integrating a 'differentiable game solver' into the loop of larger deep network architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the learning method in several settings including poker and security game tasks.","tags":null,"title":"What game are we playing?
